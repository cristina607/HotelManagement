## Wantsome - Project X

- _This is a __template__ for the final project at the end of Java course. It's
  just a basic working gradle project, with common libraries included._

- ___IMPORTANT__: after you finish your project, you should replace this content
  with something more relevant for your specific project._

  _It should contain:_
    - _short description, the __purpose and scope__ of your project_
    - ___initial setup instructions__ (init db, others?)_
    - ___usage instructions___
    - _interesting __technical details__ about how you built it (technologies
      used, db structure, code organization, etc.)_
    - _ideas for further improvements (possible new features)_

  _For nicer formatting you may using __MarkDown syntax__, see guide:
  <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown>_

_Structure example:_

### 3. Technical details

__Technologies__

- main code is written in Java (version 11)
- it uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), a small embedded database, for its
  persistence, using SQL and JDBC to access it from Java code
- it uses [Javalin](https://javalin.io/) micro web framework (which includes
  an embedded web server, Jetty)
- it uses [Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org/) templating engine,
  to separate the UI code from Java code; UI code consists of basic HTML and CSS
  code (and some Javascript)
- _others...? (junit, google charts, etc.)_
